# Text classification evaluation for Hugging Face transformers

This [notebook](text-classification.ipynb) provides instructions on running text-classification task evaluation for the ðŸ¤— Transformers models which are converted using the OpenVINOâ„¢ Integration with Optimum module. <br>
There are two parts in this evaluation: 
* Evaluating the model performance based on metrics such as the Pearson correlation coefficient. 
* Evaluating the runtime performance (in terms of throughput and latency) using the benchmark application provided by the IntelÂ® Distribution of OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit.
